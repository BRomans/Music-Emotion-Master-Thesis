\chapter{Conclusions and recommendations}
\label{chap:conclusions}
The goal of the experiment setup for this research was to answer the main research question: \emph{“What are the performances of classification of music-elicited emotional valence and arousal using a wearable EEG headset?”} and the two sub-research questions that extended it. Each question is answered separately in the following section and then some recommendations for future work are proposed in the last section.
\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
\emph{“What are the performances of classification of music-elicited emotional valence and arousal using a wearable EEG headset?”. }

For arousal classification, \ac{SVM} scored higher average test accuracy of 0.63 ± 0.09 and higher average \ac{MCC} score of 0.18 ± 0.2 compared to \ac{MLP} that scored average test accuracy of 0.59 ± 0.09 and average \ac{MCC} score of 0.15 ± 0.17. Cross-validated scores are consistent, with \ac{SVM} scoring higher average CV accuracy of 0.61 ± 0.06 and higher \ac{CV MCC} of 0.24 ± 0. 13, while \ac{MLP} scored average CV accuracy of 0.57 ± 0.07 and average \ac{CV MCC} of 0.15 ± 0.15. The highest consistent \ac{MCC} score for \ac{SVM} was 0.61 with a \ac{CV MCC} of 0.57, the highest consistent \ac{MCC} score for \ac{MLP} was also 0.61 with a \ac{CV} \ac{MCC} of 0.31. For valence classification, \ac{SVM} scored average test accuracy of 0.65 ± 0.12 and similarly \ac{MLP} scored average test accuracy of 0.65 ± 0.11. \ac{MLP} obtained higher average \ac{MCC} of 0.13 ± 0.15 against \ac{SVM} that scored average \ac{MCC} of 0.10 ± 0.19, however \ac{SVM} obtained higher CV accuracy of 0.61 ± 0.07 and higher \ac{CV} \ac{MCC} of 0.26 ± 0.15 against 0.57 ± 0.08 and 0.15 ± 0.16 respectively for \ac{MLP}. Overall, \ac{SVM} yielded more consistency between test and cross-validated scores. In addition, more under-fitted or over-fitted models were generated using \ac{MLP}, with a total of 6 negative \ac{CV MCC} scores in arousal classification against 0 obtained using \ac{SVM}, and a total of 5 negative \ac{CV MCC} scores in valence classification against 1 obtained using \ac{SVM}.

\emph{“What are the most relevant features to perform the Emotion-Recognition task using Power Spectral Density of the EEG signal?”.}

The presented results were obtained after compressing the features using PCA and the contribution of the individual features to the components was not measured. Neuromarkers and frequency band-specific spectral features showed encouraging results, but also great variability among subjects that requires more study on the causes and possible solutions. No neuromarker or subset of features could be proved to be relevant towards subject-independent classification.

\emph{“What is the most suitable classification strategy using a wearable EEG headset?.”}

For this research it was possible to obtain subjective appreciable results using a subject-dependent strategy. Subject-independent classification was discarded during intermediate experiments due to inability of the model to perform better than default guessing the majority class. Thus, subject-dependent classification strategy is for the moment the most suitable using the current wearable technology. Further investigation using more sophisticated signal processing techniques and approaches to deal with unbalanced datasets might lead to more consistent results and enable the development of better strategies that can be applied in an online system with minimal training and calibration time.

This research on affective \ac{BCI} offers various insights and possibilities for further exploring the field of affective computing. In the time assigned to the project it was only possible to scratch the surface, but hopefully an interesting and actual overview of the state-of-art methods, devices, and strategies was provided. Researchers and designers interested in building the affective technologies of tomorrow are invited to take part in this challenging and exciting world, and share their ideas, insights and solutions with the passionate community that is growing around Brain-Computer Interfaces.
