\chapter{Appendix}
\label{app:appendix_A}

The appendix roughly follows the structure of the main thesis. Some of the tables and plots from the intermediate experiments section (Appendix \ref{sec:appendix_A3}) were obtained during an exploratory phase and thus are only approximated and do not contain subject-wise information. However they should give an overview of the logical reasoning that led to the final experiment, for which more individual information is reported in Appendix \ref{sec:appendix_A4}. Individual ROC curves, labels distribution and confusion matrices are only reported for specific examples regarding the unbalance of some datasets (see Appendix \ref{sec:appendix_A3.3})

\section{Pilot study}
\label{sec:appendix_A1}
A pilot study was run internally with myBrainTechnologies employee to design the Experimental Annotator App. The choice of using mouse as input method was evaluated through A\text{\textbar}B testing with two training sessions using a demo of the app. The table reports the average usability score for each training session.
