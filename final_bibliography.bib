	abstract = {Ongoing brain activity can be recorded as electroen-cephalograph ({EEG}) to discover the links between emotional states and brain activity. This study applied machine-learning algorithms to categorize {EEG} dynamics according to subject self-reported emotional states during music listening. A framework was proposed to optimize {EEG}-based emotion recognition by systematically 1) seeking emotion-specific {EEG} features and 2) exploring the efficacy of the classifiers. Support vector machine was employed to classify four emotional states (joy, anger, sadness, and pleasure) and obtained an averaged classification accuracy of 82.29\% ± 3.06\% across 26 subjects. Further, this study identified 30 subject-independent features that were most relevant to emotional processing across subjects and explored the feasibility of using fewer electrodes to characterize the {EEG} dynamics during music listening. The identified features were primarily derived from electrodes placed near the frontal and the parietal lobes, consistent with many of the findings in the literature. This study might lead to a practical system for noninvasive assessment of the emotional states in practical or clinical applications.},

	abstract = {Music, an abstract stimulus, can arouse feelings of euphoria and craving, similar to tangible rewards that involve the striatal dopaminergic system. Using the neurochemical specificity of [(11)C]raclopride positron emission tomography scanning, combined with psychophysiological measures of autonomic nervous system activity, we found endogenous dopamine release in the striatum at peak emotional arousal during music listening. To examine the time course of dopamine release, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging with the same stimuli and listeners, and found a functional dissociation: the caudate was more involved during the anticipation and the nucleus accumbens was more involved during the experience of peak emotional responses to music. These results indicate that intense pleasure in response to music can lead to dopamine release in the striatal system. Notably, the anticipation of an abstract reward can result in dopamine release in an anatomical pathway distinct from that associated with the peak pleasure itself. Our results help to explain why music is of such high value across all human societies.},

	abstract = {Emotion Recognition from {EEG} signals has long been researched as it can assist numerous medical and rehabilitative applications. However, their complex and noisy structure has proven to be a serious barrier for traditional modeling methods. In this paper, we employ multifractal analysis to examine the behavior of {EEG} signals in terms of presence of fluctuations and the degree of fragmentation along their major frequency bands, for the task of emotion recognition. In order to extract emotion-related features we utilize two novel algorithms for {EEG} analysis, based on Multiscale Fractal Dimension and Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis. The proposed feature extraction methods perform efficiently, surpassing some widely used baseline features on the competitive {DEAP} dataset, indicating that multifractal analysis could serve as basis for the development of robust models for affective state recognition.},

	abstract = {Recommending music based on a user's music preference is a way to improve user listening experience. Finding the correlation between the user data (e.g., location, time of the day, music listening history, emotion, etc.) and the music is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose an emotion-aware personalized music recommendation system ({EPMRS}) to extract the correlation between the user data and the music. To achieve this correlation, we combine the outputs of two approaches: the deep convolutional neural networks ({DCNN}) approach and the weighted feature extraction ({WFE}) approach. The {DCNN} approach is used to extract the latent features from music data (e.g., audio signals and corresponding metadata) for classification. In the {WFE} approach, we generate the implicit user rating for music to extract the correlation between the user data and the music data. In the {WFE} approach, we use the term-frequency and inverse document frequency ({TF}-{IDF}) approach to generate the implicit user ratings for the music. Later, the {EPMRS} recommends songs to the user based on calculated implicit user rating for the music. We use the million songs dataset ({MSD}) to train the {EPMRS}. For performance comparison, we take the content similarity music recommendation system ({CSMRS}) as well as the personalized music recommendation system based on electroencephalography feedback ({PMRSE}) as the baseline systems. Experimental results show that the {EPMRS} produces better accuracy of music recommendations than the {CSMRS} and the {PMRSE}. Moreover, we build the Android and {iOS} {APPs} to get realistic data of user experience on the {EPMRS}. The collected feedback from anonymous users also show that the {EPMRS} sufficiently reflect their preference on music.},

Yet, identifying emotions using only brainwaves is still very challenging, especially the subject-independent task. Numerous studies have tried to propose methods to recognize emotions, including machine learning techniques like convolutional neural network ({CNN}). Since {CNN} has shown its potential in generalization to unseen subjects, manipulating {CNN} hyperparameters like the window size and electrode order might be beneficial. To our knowledge, this is the first work that extensively observed the parameter selection effect on the {CNN}. The temporal information in distinct window sizes was found to significantly affect the recognition performance, and {CNN} was found to be more responsive to changing window sizes than the support vector machine. Classifying the arousal achieved the best performance with a window size of ten seconds, obtaining 56.85\% accuracy and a Matthews correlation coefficient ({MCC}) of 0.1369. Valence recognition had the best performance with a window length of eight seconds at 73.34\% accuracy and an {MCC} value of 0.4669. Spatial information from varying the electrode orders had a small effect on the classification. Overall, valence results had a much more superior performance than arousal results, which were, perhaps, influenced by features related to brain activity asymmetry between the left and right hemispheres.},

We found that the pattern of asymmetrical frontal {EEG} activity distinguished valence of the musical excerpts. Subjects exhibited greater relative left frontal {EEG} activity to joy and happy musical excerpts and greater relative right frontal {EEG} activity to fear and sad musical excerpts. We also found that, although the pattern of frontal {EEG} asymmetry did not distinguish the intensity of the emotions, the pattern of overall frontal {EEG} activity did, with the amount of frontal activity decreasing from fear to joy to happy to sad excerpts.

While considering the subject-dependent and changing-over-time characteristics of emotion, our experiment included self-reporting and continuous emotion annotation in the arousal-valence space. Fractal dimension ({FD}) and power spectral density ({PSD}) approaches were adopted to extract informative features from raw {EEG} signals and then we applied emotion classification algorithms to discriminate binary classes of emotion. According to our experimental results, {FD} slightly outperformed {PSD} approach both in arousal and valence classification, and {FD} was found to have the higher correlation with emotion reports than {PSD}. In addition, continuous emotion recognition during music listening based on {EEG} was found to be an effective method for tracking emotional reporting oscillations and provides an opportunity to better understand human emotional processes.},

In Experiment 1, the participants (N = 30) evaluated 24 musical excerpts in five dimensions (pleasure, arousal, dominance, emotional tension and liking). In Experiment 2, the participants (N = 40) evaluated 48 musical excerpts. Perceptions of the musical excerpts differed significantly according to mode, even if the stimuli were Western musical excerpts. The major-mode music induced greater pleasure and arousal and produced higher liking ratings than the minor-mode music, whereas the minor-mode music induced greater tension than the major-mode music. Mode did not influence the dominance rating. Perception of Western music was not influenced by harmonic complexity. Moreover, preference for musical mode was influenced by previous exposure to Western music. These results confirm the cross-cultural emotion induction effects of musical modes in Western music.},

Familiarity with music is at least as good, if not a better, predictor of choice as are liking, satiation (which actually positively predicts choice), and regret. We suggest that the need for familiarity is driven by consumers' low need for stimulation in the music domain, and show that when the need for stimulation decreases, the power of familiarity significantly increases.

	abstract = {Numerous domestic and foreign studies have demonstrated that music can relieve stress and that listening to music is one method of stress relief used presently. Although stress-relief music is available on the market, various music genres produce distinct effects on people. Clinical findings have indicated that approximately 30 \% of people listen to inappropriate music genres for relaxation and, consequently, their stress level increases. Therefore, to achieve the effect of stress relief, choosing the appropriate music genre is crucial. For example, a 70-year-old woman living in a military community since childhood might not consider general stress-relief music to be helpful in relieving stress, but when patriotic songs are played, her autonomic nervous system automatically relaxes because of her familiarity with the music style. Therefore, people have dissimilar needs regarding stress-relief music. In this paper, we proposed a personalized stress-relieving music recommendation system based on electroencephalography ({EEG}) feedback. The system structure comprises the following features: (a) automated music categorization, in which a new clustering algorithm, K-{MeansH}, is employed to precluster music and improve processing time; (b) the access and analysis of users’ {EEG} data to identify perceived stress-relieving music; and (c) personalized recommendations based on collaborative filtering and provided according to personal preferences. Experimental results indicated that the overall clustering effect of K-{MeansH} surpassed that of K-Means and K-Medoids by approximately 71 and 57 \%, respectively. In terms of accuracy, K-{MeansH} also surpassed K-Means and K-Medoids.},

As this is precisely the result that Jacques Ellul would have predicted, this paper examines his philosophy of technology in order to investigate the relationship between Facebook and its users and what this relationship means in terms of autonomy. That Facebook can manipulate its users without losing users reveals that Facebook’s autonomy is growing while the autonomy of users is diminishing. The paper concludes by showing that the answer to this increasingly asymmetrical relationship cannot be the creation of review boards and oversight committees as the underlying issues concerning autonomy are existential more than they are ethical.},

	abstract = {Factor-analytic evidence has led most psychologists to describe affect as a set of dimensions, such as displeasure, distress, depression, excitement, and so on, with each dimension varying independently of the others. However, there is other evidence that rather than being independent, these affective dimensions are interrelated in a highly systematic fashion. The evidence suggests that these interrelationships can be represented by a spatial model in which affective concepts fall in a circle in the following order: pleasure (0), excitement (45), arousal (90), distress (135), displeasure (180), depression (225), sleepiness (270), and relaxation (315). This model was offered both as a way psychologists can represent the structure of affective experience, as assessed through self-report, and as a representation of the cognitive structure that laymen utilize in conceptualizing affect. Supportive evidence was obtained by scaling 28 emotion-denoting adjectives in 4 different ways: R. T. Ross's (1938) technique for a circular ordering of variables, a multidimensional scaling procedure based on perceived similarity among the terms, a unidimensional scaling on hypothesized pleasure–displeasure and degree-of-arousal dimensions, and a principal-components analysis of 343 Ss' self-reports of their current affective states.

Subjective reports were measured to a series of pictures that varied in both affective valence and intensity. Correlations across the two rating methods were high both for reports of experienced pleasure and felt arousal. Differences obtained in the dominance dimension of the two instruments suggest that {SAM} may better track the personal response to an affective stimulus. {SAM} is an inexpensive, easy method for quickly assessing reports of affective response in many contexts.},

{EEG} and {EOG} were recorded from 31 participants in a resting condition with eyes open and closed, allowing for spontaneous ocular activity. General effects of ocular artifacts were examined with mean comparisons, and differential effects were examined with correlation analysis of data portions that were selected for a presence or absence of artifacts.
At single sites, blinks and eye movements exerted substantial general effects on the whole {EEG} spectrum, but there were no substantial differential effects of artifacts in the alpha and beta bands, except at the frontopolar sites. The distorting effects of ocular artifacts were smaller in magnitude for asymmetry than for single site measures.
The control of ocular artifacts may be dispensable for correlation analyses of alpha or beta band parameters.},

The performance of our method were assessed on different databases containing either artificially contaminated or real artefacts recorded with different type of sensors, including wet and dry {EEG} electrodes. Furthermore, the quality of unlabelled databases was evaluated. For all the studied databases, the proposed method is able to rapidly assess the quality of the {EEG} signals with an accuracy higher than 90\%. The obtained performance suggests that our approach provide an efficient, fast and automated quality assessment of {EEG} signals from low-cost wearable devices typically composed of a dry single {EEG} channel.},

Utilizing recent frontal activation–emotion models as a theoretical framework, this study examined the pattern of resting frontal electroencephalographic ({EEG}) activity in undergraduates who self-reported high and low shyness and sociability. Analyses revealed that shyness was associated with greater relative right frontal {EEG} activity, whereas sociability was associated with greater relative left frontal {EEG} activity. Also, different combinations of shyness and sociability were distinguishable on the basis of resting frontal {EEG} power. Although high-shy/high-social and high-shy/low-social subjects both exhibited greater relative right frontal {EEG} activity, they differed significantly on {EEG} power in the left, but not right, frontal lead. High-shy/high-social subjects exhibited significantly less {EEG} power (i.e., more activity) in the left frontal lead compared with the high-shy/low-social subjects. These findings suggest that in distinguishing individual differences in personality and personality subtypes, it is important to consider not only frontal {EEG} asymmetry measures, but also the pattern of absolute {EEG} power in each frontal hemisphere.},

In particular, it is argued that these regions of the right hemisphere constitute a system involved in modulating autonomic and behavioral arousal in emotional states. This system is characterized by a set of cognitive and attentional qualities that make it uniquely suited to respond to environmental events in an adaptive fashion. The current proposal is an elaboration of a model of emotion and brain organization (Heller, 1990) that incorporates several aspects of emotional function: (a) perception and production of emotional information, (b) mood and emotional experience, and (c) autonomic arousal. In the context of this model, it is suggested that the right-hemisphere system operates in conjunction with a system localized to the frontal lobes that is involved in modulating the emotional valence of experience. The interaction of these two systems is hypothesized to be conditioned by individual differences and developmental tendencies that contribute to the production of a unique and stable pattern of personality traits and emotional characteristics.},

	abstract = {Emotion expressions can be characterized by both the type of emotion displayed and the intensity with which the emotion is expressed. Individual differences in these two aspects of emotion appear to vary independently and may perhaps account for distinct dimensions of temperament, personality, and vulnerability to psychopathology. We reviewed several sets of data gathered in our laboratory that indicate that these two dimensions of emotion expression are associated with distinct and independent patterns of frontal {EEG} activity in infants. Specifically, whereas the type of emotion expression was found to be associated with asymmetries in frontal {EEG} activity, the intensity of emotion expression was found to be associated with generalized activation of both the right and the left frontal regions. Moreover, we reviewed and provided evidence that measures of asymmetrical frontal activity are better predictors of individual differences in the tendency to express certain emotions, such as distress and sadness, whereas measures of generalized frontal activity are better predictors of individual differences in emotional reactivity and emotion intensity. The neuroanatomical bases of emotion were discussed with special reference to the role of the frontal lobe in emotion regulation. It was hypothesized that the frontal activation asymmetries that have been found to accompany emotion expressions reflect specific regulation strategies. The left frontal region is specialized for regulation strategies involving action schemes that serve to maintain continuity and stability of the organism-environment relation and of ongoing motor schemes, such as those involved in language and the expression of happiness and interest. In contrast, the right frontal region appears to be specialized for regulation strategies that involve processing novel stimuli that disrupt ongoing activity, such as might occur during the expression of fear, disgust, and distress. Furthermore, it was proposed that individual differences in patterns of frontal {EEG} asymmetries during emotion may be related to socialization influences rather than solely innate factors. It was speculated that the pattern of generalized frontal lobe activation that accompanies the experience of intense emotions may reflect, in part, the relatively diffuse influence of subcortical structures on the cortex and may serve to increase the infant's general readiness to receive and respond to significant external stimuli.},

Third, the review includes some techniques used in the signal enhancement step to deal with the artifacts in the control signals and improve the performance.

A theoretical account is provided of the role of the two hemispheres in emotional processing. This account assigns a major role in approach- and withdrawal-related behavior to the left and right frontal and anterior temporal regions of two hemispheres, respectively. Individual differences in approach- and withdrawal-related emotional reactivity and temperament are associated with stable differences in baseline measures of activation asymmetry in these anterior regions. Phasic state changes in emotion result in shifts in anterior activation asymmetry which are superimposed upon these stable baseline differences. Future directions for research in this area are discussed.},

The effect of eye state on listeners’ reaction to music has attracted some attention, but its influence on brain activity has not been fully investigated. The present study aimed to evaluate the electroencephalographic ({EEG}) markers for the emotional valence of music in different eye states. Thirty participants listened to musical excerpts with different emotional content in the eyes-closed and eyes-open states. The results showed that participants rated the music as more pleasant or with more positive valence under an eyes-open state. In addition, we found that the alpha asymmetry indices calculated on the parietal and temporal sites reflected emotion valence in the eyes-closed and eyes-open states, respectively. The theta power in the frontal area significantly increased while listening to emotional-positive music compared to emotional-negative music under the eyes-closed condition. These effects of eye states on {EEG} markers are discussed in terms of brain mechanisms underlying attention and emotion.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.clinph.2007.07.028},
	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Recent work has attempted to clarify the energetics of physiological responding and behaviour by refining and separating the operational definitions of "arousal" and "activation", which have different effects on physiological responding and behaviour. At the {EEG} level, we relate the former to widespread activity, and the latter to task-specific topographically-focussed activity reflecting regional processing. This study aimed to investigate this further in terms of differences in {EEG} activity between eyes-closed and eyes-open resting conditions.
{METHODS}: {EEG} activity was recorded from 28 university students during both eyes-closed and eyes-open resting conditions, Fourier transformed to provide estimates for absolute power in the delta, theta, alpha and beta bands, and analysed in 9 regions across the scalp. Skin conductance level was also measured as an indicator of arousal level.
{RESULTS}: Across the eyes-closed conditions, skin conductance levels were negatively correlated with mean alpha levels. Skin conductance levels increased significantly from eyes-closed to eyes-open conditions. Reductions were found in across-scalp mean absolute delta, theta, alpha and beta from the eyes-closed to eyes-open condition. Topographic changes were also evident in all bands except for alpha, with reduced lateral frontal delta and posterior theta, and decreased posterior/increased frontal beta in the eyes-open condition. In particular, the topographic beta effects indicate that the across-scalp reduction arose from focal reductions rather than global changes.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The obtained results confirm the use of mean alpha level as a measure of resting-state arousal under eyes-closed and eyes-open conditions. The focal nature of {EEG} effects in the other bands suggests that these reflect cortical processing of visual input, producing differences in activation between eyes-closed and eyes-open resting conditions, rather than just the simple increase in arousal level shown in alpha.
{SIGNIFICANCE}: This study demonstrates that the eyes-closed and eyes-open conditions provide {EEG} measures differing in topography as well as power levels. These differences should be recognised when evaluating {EEG} research, and considered when choosing eyes-open or eyes-closed baseline conditions for different paradigms.},

To verify the efficacy of the method, experiments were conducted using a dataset of brainwave and physiological signals ({EEG}, {ECG}, {GSR}) captured from nine subjects listening to music. The proposed method uses a combination of signal-based features as well as accelerometer data to quantify the approximate reliability of each modality. In contrast to existing approaches, unstable modalities are not rejected outright, instead their relative contribution is dynamically adapted based on a corresponding stability index. In the case of {EEG}, the stability index was calculated using an artifact rejection technique, while for the {ECG} and {GSR} modalities it was calculated based on body movement detected through accelerometers. The experimental results show that temporally varying the relative contribution of each modality can improve emotion recognition performance.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: To evaluate binary classifications and their confusion matrices, scientific researchers can employ several statistical rates, accordingly to the goal of the experiment they are investigating. Despite being a crucial issue in machine learning, no widespread consensus has been reached on a unified elective chosen measure yet. Accuracy and F1 score computed on confusion matrices have been (and still are) among the most popular adopted metrics in binary classification tasks. However, these statistical measures can dangerously show overoptimistic inflated results, especially on imbalanced datasets.
{RESULTS}: The Matthews correlation coefficient ({MCC}), instead, is a more reliable statistical rate which produces a high score only if the prediction obtained good results in all of the four confusion matrix categories (true positives, false negatives, true negatives, and false positives), proportionally both to the size of positive elements and the size of negative elements in the dataset.
{CONCLUSIONS}: In this article, we show how {MCC} produces a more informative and truthful score in evaluating binary classifications than accuracy and F1 score, by first explaining the mathematical properties, and then the asset of {MCC} in six synthetic use cases and in a real genomics scenario. We believe that the Matthews correlation coefficient should be preferred to accuracy and F1 score in evaluating binary classification tasks by all scientific communities.},

	abstract = {Predictions of the secondary structure of T4 phage lysozyme, made by a number of investigators on the basis of the amino acid sequence, are compared with the structure of the protein determined experimentally by X-ray crystallography. Within the amino terminal half of the molecule the locations of helices predicted by a number of methods agree moderately well with the observed structure, however within the carboxyl half of the molecule the overall agreement is poor. For eleven different helix predictions, the coefficients giving the correlation between prediction and observation range from 0.14 to 0.42. The accuracy of the predictions for both beta-sheet regions and for turns are generally lower than for the helices, and in a number of instances the agreement between prediction and observation is no better than would be expected for a random selection of residues. The structural predictions for T4 phage lysozyme are much less successful than was the case for adenylate kinase (Schulz et al. (1974) Nature 250, 140-142). No one method of prediction is clearly superior to all others, and although empirical predictions based on larger numbers of known protein structure tend to be more accurate than those based on a limited sample, the improvement in accuracy is not dramatic, suggesting that the accuracy of current empirical predictive methods will not be substantially increased simply by the inclusion of more data from additional protein structure determinations.},

By its nature, such data is large and complex, making automated processing essential. This paper shows how lack of attention to the very early stages of an {EEG} preprocessing pipeline can reduce the signal-to-noise ratio and introduce unwanted artifacts into the data, particularly for computations done in single precision. We demonstrate that ordinary average referencing improves the signal-to-noise ratio, but that noisy channels can contaminate the results. We also show that identification of noisy channels depends on the reference and examine the complex interaction of filtering, noisy channel identification, and referencing. We introduce a multi-stage robust referencing scheme to deal with the noisy channel-reference interaction. We propose a standardized early-stage {EEG} processing pipeline ({PREP}) and discuss the application of the pipeline to more than 600 {EEG} datasets. The pipeline includes an automatically generated report for each dataset processed. Users can download the {PREP} pipeline as a freely available {MATLAB} library from http://eegstudy.org/prepcode.},

	abstract = {A traditional model of emotion cannot explain the differences in brain activities between two discrete emotions that are similar in the valence-arousal coordinate space. The current study elicited two positive emotions (amusement and tenderness) and two negative emotions (anger and fear) that are similar in both valence and arousal dimensions to examine the differences in brain activities in these emotional states. Frontal electroencephalographic ({EEG}) asymmetry and midline power in three bands (theta, alpha and beta) were measured when participants watched affective film excerpts. Significant differences were detected between tenderness and amusement on {FP}1/{FP}2 theta asymmetry, F3/F4 theta and alpha asymmetry. Significant differences between anger and fear on {FP}1/{FP}2 theta asymmetry and F3/F4 alpha asymmetry were also observed. For midline power, midline theta power could distinguish two negative emotions, while midline alpha and beta power could effectively differentiate two positive emotions. Liking and dominance were also related to {EEG} features. Stepwise multiple linear regression results revealed that frontal alpha and theta asymmetry could predict the subjective feelings of two positive and two negative emotions in different patterns. The binary classification accuracy, which used {EEG} frontal asymmetry and midline power as features and support vector machine ({SVM}) as classifiers, was as high as 64.52\% for tenderness and amusement and 78.79\% for anger and fear. The classification accuracy was improved after adding these features to other features extracted across the scalp. These findings indicate that frontal {EEG} asymmetry and midline power might have the potential to recognize discrete emotions that are similar in the valence-arousal coordinate space.},

	abstract = {Electroencephalogram ({EEG}) signals are highly subject-specific and vary considerably even between recording sessions of the same user within the same experimental paradigm. This challenges a stable operation of Brain-Computer Interface ({BCI}) systems. The classical approach is to train users by neurofeedback to produce fixed stereotypical patterns of brain activity. In the machine learning approach, a widely adapted method for dealing with those variances is to record a so called calibration measurement on the beginning of each session in order to optimize spatial filters and classifiers specifically for each subject and each day. This adaptation of the system to the individual brain signature of each user relieves from the need of extensive user training. In this paper we suggest a new method that overcomes the requirement of these time-consuming calibration recordings for long-term {BCI} users. The method takes advantage of knowledge collected in previous sessions: By a novel technique, prototypical spatial filters are determined which have better generalization properties compared to single-session filters. In particular, they can be used in follow-up sessions without the need to recalibrate the system. This way the calibration periods can be dramatically shortened or even completely omitted for these 'experienced' {BCI} users. The feasibility of our novel approach is demonstrated with a series of online {BCI} experiments. Although performed without any calibration measurement at all, no loss of classification performance was observed.},

	abstract = {Zero-training {BCI} was presented to overcome the inconvenience and impractical aspects of the training session in the Brain-Computer Interface ({BCI}) based on Motor Imagery ({MI}). Zero-training {BCI} can be classified into a session-to-session transfer {BCI} and a subject-independent {BCI}. The session-to-session transfer {BCI} is characterized by high classification accuracy, but there is a limitation that the model could not be improved as the number of subjects increased. On the other hand, the subject-independent {BCI} has advantage in increasing the number of subjects, but had the problem of requiring too many subjects for high accuracy. In this study, we proposed the hybrid zero-training {BCI} that integrates the advantages of the aforementioned two methods and Multidomain {CNN} that combined time-, spatial-, and phase-domain, and aimed for more practical application and higher classification accuracy. We collected three-class {MI} {EEG} data related to lower-limb movement (gait, sit-down, and rest) from three subjects with three sessions per subject.

The f1 classification measure of 54.9\% that was obtained on three emotional classes with a naïve Bayes classifier was improved to 63.4\% after utilizing all the priors.},

	shorttitle = {'{FEELTRACE}'},
	abstract = {{FEELTRACE} is an instrument developed to let observers track the emotional content of a stimulus as they perceive it over time, allowing the emotional dynamics of speech episodes to be examined. It is based on activation-evaluation space, a representation derived from psychology. The activation dimension measures how dynamic the emotional state is; the evaluation dimension is a global measure of the positive or negative feeling associated with the state. Research suggests that the space is naturally circular, i.e. states which are at the limit of emotional intensity define a circle, with alert neutrality at the centre. To turn those ideas into a recording tool, the space was represented by a circle on a computer screen, and observers described perceived emotional state by moving a pointer (in the form of a disc) to the appropriate point in the circle, using a mouse. Prototypes were tested, and in the light of results, refinements were made to ensure that outputs were as consistent and meaningful as possible. They include colour coding the pointer in a way that users readily associate with the relevant emotional state; presenting key emotion words as 'landmarks' at the strategic points in the space; and developing an induction procedure to introduce observers to the system. An experiment assessed the reliability of the developed system. Stimuli were 16 clips from {TV} programs, two showing relatively strong emotions in each quadrant of activation- evaluation space, each paired with one of the same person in a relatively neural state. 24 raters took part. Differences between clips chosen to contrast were statistically robust. Results were plotted in activation-evaluation space as ellipses, each with its centre at the mean co-ordinates for the clip, and its width proportional to standard deviation across raters. The size of the ellipses meant that about 25 could be fitted into the space, i.e. {FEELTRACE} has resolving power comparable to an emotion vocabulary of 20 non-overlapping words, with the advantage of allowing intermediate ratings, and above all, the ability to track impressions continuously.},

	abstract = {One of the greatest challenges that hinder the decoding and application of electroencephalography ({EEG}) is that {EEG} recordings almost always contain artifacts - non-brain signals. Among existing automatic artifact-removal methods, artifact subspace reconstruction ({ASR}) is an online and realtime capable, component-based method that can effectively remove transient or large-amplitude artifacts. However, the effectiveness of {ASR} and the optimal choice of its parameter have not been evaluated and reported, especially on real {EEG} data. This study systematically validates {ASR} on ten {EEG} recordings in a simulated driving experiment. Independent component analysis ({ICA}) is applied to separate artifacts from brain signals to allow a quantitative assessment of {ASR}'s effectiveness in removing various types of artifacts and preserving brain activities. Empirical results show that the optimal {ASR} parameter is between 10 and 100, which is small enough to remove activities from artifacts and eye-related components and large enough to retain signals from brain-related components. With the appropriate choice of the parameter, {ASR} can be a powerful and automatic artifact removal approach for offline data analysis or online real-time {EEG} applications such as clinical monitoring and brain-computer interfaces.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Electroencephalography ({EEG}) is widely used to investigate human brain function. Simulation studies are essential for assessing the validity of {EEG} analysis methods and the interpretability of results.
{NEW} {METHOD}: Here we present a simulation environment for generating {EEG} data by embedding biologically plausible signal and noise into {MRI}-based forward models that incorporate individual-subject variability in structure and function.
{RESULTS}: The package includes pipelines for the evaluation and validation of {EEG} analysis tools for source estimation, functional connectivity, and spatial filtering. {EEG} dynamics can be simulated using realistic noise and signal models with user specifiable signal-to-noise ratio ({SNR}). We also provide a set of quantitative metrics tailored to source estimation, connectivity and spatial filtering applications.
{COMPARISON} {WITH} {EXISTING} {METHOD}(S): We provide a larger set of forward solutions for individual {MRI}-based head models than has been available previously. These head models are surface-based and include two sets of regions-of-interest ({ROIs}) that have been brought into registration with the brain of each individual using surface-based alignment - one from a whole brain and the other from a visual cortex atlas. We derive a realistic model of noise by fitting different model components to measured resting state {EEG}. We also provide a set of quantitative metrics for evaluating source-localization, functional connectivity and spatial filtering methods.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The inclusion of a larger number of individual head-models, combined with surface-atlas based labeling of {ROIs} and plausible models of signal and noise, allows for simulation of {EEG} data with greater realism than previous packages.},
