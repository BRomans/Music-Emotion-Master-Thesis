# Music-Emotion: Towards real-time recognition of affective states using a wearable Brain-Computer Interface

This repository contains the LaTex revision of my master thesis in Human-Computer Interaction & Design.
This research set out to investigate the feasibility of performing Emotion-Recognition
using Melomind, a wearable neural interface manufactured by myBrainTechnologies. Melomind is capable of recording EEG signals, that can be processed using
machine learning algorithms in the form of a classification task of the emotional
dimensions of valence and arousal.
